# SUPLA for BZ
### Sound Pressure Level Analyzer for BZ-5503 data.

An advanced web application to upload, visualize, and analyze sound pressure level data from BZ-5503 CSV files. Features customizable charts, frequency weighting (A, C, Z), and powerful export options including PNG, SVG, TXT, and batch ZIP downloads.

This project was generated by an AI assistant and is a fully functional, static single-page application that runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

-   **Client-Side CSV Parsing**: Upload and process CSV files directly in your browser. No server needed.
-   **Interactive Bar Chart**: Visualize sound pressure levels across 1/3 octave frequency bands using Recharts.
-   **Multiple Measurements**: Display and compare several measurements on the same chart.
-   **Frequency Weighting**: Dynamically apply A-Weighting, C-Weighting, or Z-Weighting (flat) to your data.
-   **Deep Customization**:
    -   Toggle visibility and edit names/colors for each measurement.
    -   Filter the displayed frequency range.
    -   Customize chart axis labels in real-time.
    -   Modify chart colors (background, grid, text).
    -   Show or hide dB values on each bar.
-   **Powerful Exporting**:
    -   Export the current chart view as a PNG or SVG image.
    -   Export the current chart data as a tab-separated TXT file.
    -   Batch export all measurements into a single ZIP archive, with a choice of PNG, SVG, or TXT format for each file.

## How to Run
Since this is a static web application with no build process, you can run it by simply opening the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. For the best experience and to avoid potential security issues with local file access (`file:///`), it's recommended to serve the files using a simple local server.

1.  **Using Python's built-in server:**
    -   Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
    -   Run `python -m http.server` (for Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2).
    -   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Using VS Code's Live Server extension:**
    -   Install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
    -   Right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This application is perfectly suited for deployment on GitHub Pages. The process is very simple because there are no build steps.

1.  **Create a new GitHub Repository:**
    -   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository. For example, name it `supla-for-bz`.

2.  **Upload Your Files:**
    -   Upload all the project files (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) to your new repository. You can do this via the web interface or by using Git commands (`git init`, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`).

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    -   In your repository on GitHub, go to the **Settings** tab.
    -   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    -   Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
    -   Under "Branch", select your main branch (usually `main` or `master`) and keep the folder as `/(root)`.
    -   Click **Save**.

4.  **Done!**
    -   GitHub will now publish your site. It might take a minute or two.
    -   Once it's live, the URL will be displayed at the top of the Pages settings. It will look like: `https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/`

    Automatic deployment using GitHub Actions

    This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and deploys the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` or `master`.

    - To change the repository path used by the built assets, edit the `base` option in `vite.config.ts` or set a repository secret named `VITE_BASE` with the desired base path (for example: `/your-repo-name/`).

    To enable the workflow:

    1.  Push this project to a GitHub repository (e.g., `supla-for-bz`).
    2.  If you want to override the default base path, go to the repository Settings â†’ Secrets and create `VITE_BASE` with the value `/your-repo-name/`.
    3.  The workflow will run on push and publish the site to GitHub Pages.
